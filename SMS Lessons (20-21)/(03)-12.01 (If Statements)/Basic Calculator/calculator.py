# Recap of last week
# print("") : prints out whatever is between the quotes
# print("a", "b") prints out multiple strings with a space (use + for without space)
# Variables: Integers (whole numbers), String (letters, but could be anything), Boolean (True/False)
# input(): takes input from user
# int(input()) and str(input()) changes input to integer or string (string by default)

# Using everything weâ€™ve learned so far, create a simple calculator with the following requirements 
# Inputs: A number 1-4 to specify a function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
# Two numbers on seperate lines to carry out the function on 
# Output: The result from carrying out the function on the two numbers
# ex:
# 2 (subtraction)
# 17 (first number)
# 5 (second number)
# 12 (17 - 5 = 12)

# Bonus Challenge: Make the calculator print in the format "The 'sum/difference/product/quotient' is 'answer'"
# ex. 
# 1
# 4
# 7
# The sum is 11
