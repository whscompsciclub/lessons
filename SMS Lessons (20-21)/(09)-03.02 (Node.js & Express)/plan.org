#+setupfile: ./setup.org

- Install node
- npm install -g express-generator
- express -e --git demo-website
- cd demo-website
- npm install
- app.js
  + imports modules & custom routes (talk about how modules are just javascript files)
- HTTP
  + a common language for web servers and browsers (clients)
  + when visiting a website, browser sends HTTP request to server
    - request type + headers + request body (only for certain types)
    - common request types
      + GET: request webpage content
        - url & query parameters (?param1=value&param2=value&param3=value...)
      + POST: upload data to server
        - has a url and body which contains data
  + website responds with status code and the requested page if the request suceeds
    - common status codes (maybe go to wikipedia for http codes)
      + 200: OK
      + 400: bad request
      + 401: not authorized
      + 403: forbidden
      + 404: not found
      + 500: internal server error
- continue app.js
  + router is for different routes in an URL, like /, /user, /product, /search, etc
  + each router may handle different request types with different URL formats
  + view engines allow programmers to run javascript to dynamic change the HTML before sending it to the client
  + cookies are data stored in the browser that get sent along every HTTP request
    - store session ID: useful for proving identity without directly storing plaintext password
    - server can see cookies in requests and set the cookie in responses
  + rudimentary stages / loop of a website: development - staging - deployment - production
    - testing in development (or staging), never in production
    - don't output sensitive server info for security
  + middleware: app.use(middleware), intermediate function that process the request partially before it reaches the actual programmer's code; you can create your own middlewares for stuff shared between all handlers
    - loggers, express.json parses json in body, urlencoded data in body (percent sign encodings), parse cookies in headers, serve static files in public
    - req : request object
    - res : response object
    - next : next middleware, called when done
  + check out routes/index.js
    - routing methods & handler functions
      : router.HTTP_REQUEST('/path/to/the/page', (req, res) => {})
- starting the server
  + comment out module.exports = app; add app.listen(8080);
  + npm i -g nodemon
  + nodemon app.js
- if there's still time
  + upload to github
  + deploy site to heroku
  + showcase last year's demo
